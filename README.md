# DeepScatteringModels
Physics of Electromagnetic Scattering Models explored with Deep Learning tools.

The material collected in this repository correspond to an area of study called "Physics-Based Deep Learning", a field that
combines physical modeling and numerical analisys with deep learning (DL) techniques. In this case, Electromagnetic
Scattering Models (SM) for random media problems and their solutions are studied using Autoencoders.

The SM used here are of special interest in the Remote Sensing field. Examples of such models are: Small Perturbations Method (SPM) 
Kirchhoff Aproximation (KA) and Small Slope Aproxiation (SSA).
